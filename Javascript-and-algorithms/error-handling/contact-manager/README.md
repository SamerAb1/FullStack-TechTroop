# Contact Manager CLI

A modular command-line Contact Manager built with Node.js.  
**Handles contacts with robust error handling, validation, and clear user feedback.**

## Features

- **Add**, **delete**, **list**, and **search** contacts
- All contacts stored in a JSON file with error recovery for missing or corrupted files
- Input validation with custom error messages (e.g., invalid email, duplicate contacts)
- Clear, user-friendly output modeled after real CLI utilities
- Modular codebase (separate logic for validation, file IO, services, and command handling)
