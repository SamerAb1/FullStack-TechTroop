        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Samer Abuhaya.  a curious and enthusiastic learner diving into the world of web development.

        <p>I’m passionate about coding because it blends creativity with logical thinking. When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading science fiction,
             hiking in nature, and experimenting with new recipes. I’m also deeply interested in sustainable technology and how software can help create a more sustainable future..</p>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer capable of building complete web applications from the ground up. I aim to specialize in developing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that make technology accessible to all.
             In the future, I hope to contribute to open-source projects and eventually launch my own tech startup focused on educational technology.</p>
        <h3>Short-term Goals</h3>
        <p>In the coming months, I plan to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, develop a strong portfolio, and begin contributing to the developer community through blog posts and shared code.
